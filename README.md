# About

This project relates to Worksheet 8 of the course [02561 - Computer Graphics (DTU Compute)](http://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02561), exploring and implementing two additional improvements for Shadow Mapping: Percentage Closer Filtering (PCF) and Variance Shadow Mapping (VSM)

Final result of this project is a WebGL implementation of the above mentioned techniques (plus default Shadow Mapping for comparison) and can be found at the following url [:arrow_upper_right:](http://student.dtu.dk/~s062870/02561/project/)
